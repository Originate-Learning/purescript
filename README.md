Learning Purescript
================

## Motivations

This is a dedicated repo to help motivate the members, and anyone else, to learn the programming language Purescript.
The conventions of this repo will be to have contributors namespace their research and contributions under a folder by their
github handle. Anything that should live at the root of the repo will go through a typical review process, since this information
at the root of the repo should mostly be resources and the main syllabus. Feel free to experiment with this structure however you want.

## Resources

Phil Freeman's book, [PureScript by Example](https://leanpub.com/purescript/read), has now been updated for the 0.7 version of the compiler -- and it's free! Free! PureScript for everyone!

## Contributing

If you're looking to contribute to an open-source project, [purescript-bitcore](https://github.com/cxfreeio/purescript-bitcore) could use some love.
